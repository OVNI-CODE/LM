## Linguistic-Masticator<br><br>
A machine to chew words<br> 
The Linguistic Masticator is a software device which 'chews up the words' <br>
I say software, but in fact its teeth are very hard. <br>
It can snap any text into segments into sub-segs <br>
Sub-segs get smaller as the teeth 'chew' <br>
We soon end up with letters, not words. <br>
I can't more say anymore, because my words are all wchepud<br>
